  title:  I first discovered that life could be hard when I was a small child. 
  description: >
    There have been many circumstances over the years that have pointed me in this direction, but several stand out a little more than others. My family moved frequently as my father was in the military and we lived on multiple military bases for many years. We sometimes switched schools mid-year. When I was 7 years-old my father died suddenly of a heart attack. Life got a little harder. When I was 16 years old a man who targeted my mother and forced her to marry him took her life when she tried to leave him and almost took mine in the process. My siblings and I proceeded in life without parents. I went to college, married and have 4 amazing children. At one point I faced a difficult job situation where I was targeted and mistreated by superiors for reporting unethical and potential illegal behaviors by a colleague. It tripped me up for a while and hope did not seem to be present at the moment. My self-esteem and self-worth took some plunges over the years as they do for each one of us, but with God’s help, I figured out how to keep moving and how to encourage others to do the same. In the Spring of 2019, it became evident that I needed to leave a multiple-decades marriage due to a really difficult environment that was not changing after many years of prayer, service and hard work.

        Pray and proceed. No matter where you are spiritually, I want to encourage you and be supportive. Life is not easy so our relationship with God will have its ups and downs. My hope is that you find what you need here and are able to experience some healing and grace.

        You can’t work on what you don’t notice. Have you ever heard the saying, “You don’t know what you don’t know”? When we are in the midst of difficulty it’s easy to lose sight of big picture thinking and to get discouraged. We zoom in and get stuck. My hope is that you will find strength and support in the stories you read and be able to expand your horizons into personal growth opportunities.

        Empty your wheelbarrow. Idea here is lightening the load. This is an analogy I use with patients – a full wheelbarrow gets heavier as the day goes on, others can have easy access to manipulate us to carry the things they should be responsible for (i.e. emotions), throw their junk in or we grab their “stuff” out of their wheelbarrow and put in ours because no canopy/top (boundaries&communication importance); weight of stress takes a toll on our energy level. Each of us have the responsibility of appropriately caring for ourselves, lifting and pushing our own wheelbarrow, protecting and preserving our energy for the future; at the end of the day the wheelbarrow sits on top of us in bed – heavy or light is our choice.
