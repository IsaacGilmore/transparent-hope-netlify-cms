### My story

I have a lot of siblings. When you're young, siblings meant playmates were readily accessible and I loved playing games, making crafts and being outdoors. We moved frequently as our dad was in the Air Force. Unfortunately, we learned early that life is fragile and can come to a screeching halt. Our dad died of a heart attack when I was 7 years old. Up until then I hadn't thought much about death and hadn't encountered it in such a big way. Life changed immediately. My mom became a single mom. She was pregnant with my younger brother and brought him into our fractured family. After 6 months of living with grandparents we moved into our own home and that's where we stayed for many years. I enjoyed the pleasure of play but also learned about manipulation and power and control. Only I didn't know I was learning that lesson. At age 16, I watched as my mom was gunned down by a man who manipulated her into marrying him a few months earlier and kept her isolated on his remote farm. I too was shot that day. I should have died but I didn't. The bullet in my jaw is a reminder that God was gracious and allowed me to live in spite of blood pouring out of me and having to travel a great distance to the closest hospital. A couple of years later I went to college and met someone I thought I would grow old with. Someone I could trust. As soon as he was through college, I helped him pursue his dreams and he promised to help me pursue mine. Things were shaky over the years. There was a lot of good but there were also very difficult things to deal with. He switched professions and we served in ministry in several different locations. Even though we were serving God, hope was elusive at times. I slid into acceptance that this was the best I could hope for in life. I focused on serving others and caring for my children as I fasted and prayed fervently for my marriage. I found myself angry, confused, and disillusioned. After many years of struggling, my marriage didn't last. When this happens we struggle in many ways, including with anger, shame and regret. They need a place to land. God has been healing and transforming me and giving me hope. My story is not complete and it truly brings me great honor to share life with you as I do my best to keep hope in the room. To be transparent enough with my story, that you see it too. 

### Single origin

Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans from a single country. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it was grown to whatever degree available.

### Sustainable farming

Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.

### Direct sourcing

Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.

### Reinvest profits

We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you. Thatâ€™s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about coffee farming on our blog.
